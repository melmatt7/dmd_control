--Device: Virtex-5
--Design Name: DDR2
--Purpose:
--   This module instantiates the IDELAYCTRL primitive of the Virtex-5 device
--   which continuously calibrates the IDELAY elements in the region in case of
--   varying operating conditions. It takes a 200MHz clock as an input
--Reference:
--Revision History:
--   Rev 1.1 - Parameter IODELAY_GRP added and constraint IODELAY_GROUP added
--             on IOELAYCTRL primitive. Generate logic on IDELAYCTRL removed
--             since tools will replicate idelactrl primitives.PK. 11/27/08
